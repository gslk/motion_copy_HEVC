# Usage
This repositary contains a linux build of the HEVC HM decoder. The standard HEVC decoder which does not support packet losses has been modified to support motion copy based error concealment. The usage of the executable is MOTION_COPY_DECODER -b input.bin where input.bin is the corrupted HM encoded bit stream.
